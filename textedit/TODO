ON DECK:
	It was an EOF issue smh -__-
	Cursor can go way too far right for some reason (might be a file scalar
	thing)
	tobot - C-j appears to be some sort of insertion thing, idk how to override

PRIMARY:
	scrolling
	replace the gotos with break

SECONDARY:
	Syntax Highlighting
	Use unctrl() to simplify regexes?
	make up/down work all nicey-nice

SALAD DRESSING:
	Cleaning and reorganizing code

BUGS:
	Working (known): save, newfile, end, paste, find, saveas, cut and copy, 	key_up
	Borked: , key_down (freezes everything, can't type or do commands), , undo, tobot - inserts a newline, trying to go past 0 in the array will break everything

DEBUGGING NOTES:
